# My Development Environment Crashed! Here's What Happened
### What Happened?

My development environment, which is basically all the tools I use to write code, stopped working. This meant some programs I use every day, like the package manager and the code editor, wouldn't work right. Luckily, I didn't lose any important files, but it took a few hours to fix everything.

### Why Did It Happen?

I was trying to test a new program for my project. To do this quickly, I installed a special version of a program called Node.js directly from the internet. This turned out to be a bad idea! This special version wasn't compatible with the other programs on my computer, so it messed them all up.

### How Did I Fix It?

I figured out what went wrong and uninstalled the special Node.js program. Then, I put the normal version of Node.js back on my computer and told the other programs to use that version again. Finally, everything started working like it should.

### What Did I Learn?

There are a few things I learned from this mistake:

Always use a program called a "version manager" to install different versions of Node.js. This way, they won't mess up the other programs on my computer.
Test new programs in a separate space on my computer, not where I'm working on my main project. This way, if something goes wrong, it won't break everything.
Do more research before installing programs from the internet, especially if they aren't from an official source.
By following these tips, I can avoid making the same mistake in the future and keep my development environment running smoothly!
